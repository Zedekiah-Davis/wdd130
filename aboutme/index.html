    <h2>Zedekiah Davis</h2>
    <h2>Z</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Zedekiah, but I've just gone by Z for as long as I can remember. I was born in Taiwan and grew up in Idaho Falls. When I was younger I used to visit Taiwan with my family,</p>
    <p>but since I'm a dual citizen I actually can't go back unless I revoke my citizenship or I'll be drafted for military training.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Sports has been a big part of my life since I was young. I ran track and field in highschool as a hurdler and I loved the competitive envrionment.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite things to do is developing a new hobby or skill that catches my eye. The most recent ones include learning the piano, chess, and starting a book club with some friends.</p>
